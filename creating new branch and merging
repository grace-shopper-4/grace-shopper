1. first make sure your local master branch is up to date with the remote one (do git pull or git pull origin master)

2. to make a new branch => git checkout -b new-branch-name

3. go back to code editor and do whatever, then git add *, git commit, and git push origin new-branch-name

4. look at <>Code. new branch should be on the remote github repo now under the branches tab. click "new pull request" 
  and fill out whatever comments you want, then submit.

5. you should see your pull request under the pull requests tab. any one of us should be able to merge your new branch with the master.

6. after it's merged you could delete your local new-branch-name
